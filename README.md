This document discusses and reflects on the design of your platformer level for the Level Design assessment. It should be 1500 words. Make sure you delete this and all other instructional text throughout the document before checking your word count prior to submission. Hint: You can check word count by copying this text into a Word or Google doc.

Your document must include images. To insert an image into your documentation, place it in the "DocImages" folder in this repo, then place the below text where you want the image to appear:

## 1. Player Experience (~700 words)
Outline and justify how your level design facilitates the core player experience goals outlined in the assignment spec. Each section should be supported by specific examples and screenshots of your game encounters that highlight design choices made to facilitate that particular experience.

### 1.1. Discovery
The game includes many mechanics which the player requires to learn in order to progress.The initial discovery the player may make, are the movement and close range enemy known as ‘chomper’ as well as how to avoid the said enemy. After successfully evading ‘chomper’, player then presented with a long range enemy known as a ‘spitter’ which does damage over projectiles which the player discovers to avoid and get out of the enemy range of attack. After these discoveries, player is presented with a passthrough platform which requires the player to combine various forms of movement combinations to discover how to go to the below level while also being attacked by a ‘spitter’.If a player in reckless, they will discover that ’spikes’ will pose an danger to their adventure.In addition to these discoveries, players are expected to understand spikes,acid, checkpoints, pushable boxes, breakable walls, health boxes, weapons of staff and gun. Players are moderately under pressure to discover the world so that they wont be bored or overwhelmed during the play.

### 1.2. Drama
What is the intensity curve? How does your design facilitate increasing yet modulating intensity, with moments of tension and relief? 

### 1.3. Challenge
At the beginnig of the level, player is presented with an imminent danger of a ‘chomper’ which forces the player to take swift action to avoid the danger. Once they have avoided the 1st danger, the intense pressure gets reduced and allows them to figure out which way to go in order to progress the game. The difficulty of the game is high till the player acquires any of the weapons. After obtaining a weapon, difficulty of the game drops down and gradually increases. Intensity of the game is at medium when the player is required to pass through acid, as any contact with this danger causes immediate death and minor progression lost.The dramatic intensity is at its highest when the play has to defeat many enemies at once during the encounter of collecting the 2nd key. After they have defeated the enemies and achieved the key, health points are presented as rewards for their great performance  in their attacks while also allowing the current space as a resting place.
### 1.4. Exploration
The game’s objective is to collect 3 keys in order to open the door and progress to next level. By scattering the keys in 3 different locations, player is encouraged to explore the various paths provided. The first enemy encounter at the beginnig of the game allows the player to quickly explore the surrounding areas for a escape route. Player is allowed to see the final key at the beginnig of the level, so that they understand what they need to do. Since the players path to get that key is blocked by an enemy and a wall, they are encouraged to explore the paths provided to them. They are 3 main sections of the game. 1st area the player is exposed to is the surface level which has more green coloured paths, 2nd area requires the player to explore the air with the use of moving platforms in order to get to the 3rd and last area which is the underground section. Environment is lacking of green colour and more dangers are present in this area
## 2. Core Gameplay (~400 words)
A section on Core Gameplay, where storyboards are used to outline how you introduce the player to each of the required gameplay elements in the first section of the game. Storyboards should follow the format provided in lectures.

Storyboards can be combined when multiple mechanics are introduced within a single encounter. Each section should include a sentence or two to briefly justify why you chose to introduce the mechanic/s to the player in that sequence.

You should restructure the headings below to match the order they appear in your level.

### 2.1. Acid

### 2.2. Checkpoints

### 2.3. Chompers

### 2.4. Health Pickups

### 2.5. Keys

### 2.6. Moving Platforms

### 2.7. Passthrough Platforms

### 2.8. Spikes

### 2.9. Spitters

### 2.10. Weapon Pickup (Gun)
(DocImages/Storyboard for passthrough platform, spikes, staff.drawio.png)

### 2.11. Weapon Pickup (Staff)

## 3. Spatiotemporal Design
A section on Spatiotemporal Design, which includes your molecule diagram and annotated level maps (one for each main section of your level). These diagrams may be made digitally or by hand, but must not be created from screenshots of your game. The annotated level maps should show the structure you intend to build, included game elements, and the path the player is expected to take through the level. Examples of these diagrams are included in the level design lectures.

No additional words are necessary for this section (any words should only be within your images/diagrams).
 
### 3.1. Molecule Diagram

### 3.2. Level Map – Section 1
![Image_showing_the_1st_level_map](DocImages/<1st section of level map.drawio.png>)
### 3.3.	Level Map – Section 2

### 3.4.	Level Map – Section 3

## 4. Iterative Design (~400 words)
Reflect on how iterative design helped to improve your level. Additional prototypes and design artefacts should be included to demonstrate that you followed an iterative design process (e.g. pictures of paper prototypes, early grey-boxed maps, additional storyboards of later gameplay sequences, etc.). You can also use this section to justify design changes made in Unity after you drew your level design maps shown in section 3. 

You should conclude by highlighting a specific example of an encounter, or another aspect of your level design, that could be improved through further iterative design.

## Generative AI Use Acknowledgement

Use the below table to indicate any Generative AI or writing assistance tools used in creating your document. Please be honest and thorough in your reporting, as this will allow us to give you the marks you have earnt. Place any drafts or other evidence inside this repository. This form and related evidence do not count to your word count.
An example has been included. Please replace this with any actual tools, and add more as necessary.


### Tool Used: ChatGPT
**Nature of Use** Finding relevant design theory.

**Evidence Attached?** Screenshot of ChatGPT conversation included in the folder "GenAI" in this repo.

**Additional Notes:** I used ChatGPT to try and find some more relevant design theory that I could apply to my game. After googling them, however, I found most of them were inaccurate, and some didn't exist. One theory mentioned, however, was useful, and I've incorporated it into my work.
